New Insights Added:

Badges - Visual labels for special bubbles:
📈 PEAK - Highest NPS in the dataset
📉 TROUGH - Lowest NPS in the dataset
⚠️ OUTLIER - Statistically unusual (>1.5 std deviations from mean)
Trend Indicators - Comparison to previous period:
Shows +/- change vs previous bubble with colored arrows (↑↓→)
Green/red coloring based on direction
Performance vs Average - Shows how this bubble compares to the overall average NPS with +/- points difference
Social Sentiment Correlation - Contextual insight when social sentiment diverges from survey sentiment:
💬 "Social sentiment more positive than surveys"
⚡ "Social sentiment lagging behind surveys"
Volume Context - Labels high/low volume periods relative to average
Detractor/Promoter Alerts:
🚨 High detractor warning when >40%
🌟 Strong promoter callout when >50%
Call-to-action - "Click for detailed analysis →" prompting users to explore further
The tooltip now dynamically calculates these insights based on the bubble's position in the dataset, making each one contextually relevant rather than just showing raw data.

bubble insights are calculated based on the bubble's position in the dataset, making each one contextually relevant rather than just showing raw data.

Summary - Contextual description based on whether this is a peak/trough/above/below average NPS point

Key Drivers including:

NPS composition analysis (Promoter/Passive/Detractor breakdown)
Trend vs previous period
Social sentiment correlation insight
Volume context
Top themes
Timeline Reasoning with detailed period metrics

Suggested Actions tailored to the bubble's characteristics (e.g., Detractor recovery if high detractor %, Promoter leverage if strong promoter base)

Suggested Questions that adapt based on the bubble's data (e.g., "Why is the detractor rate so high?" if detractors > 40%)

Follow-up Q&A with a contextual question about what drove the NPS for that period

The insights now provide the same contextual analysis as the enhanced tooltips, creating a consistent experience between the quick tooltip preview and the full research panel deep-dive.

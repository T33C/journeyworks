  - speaker: Agent
    text: Certainly, I'd be happy to help. This product is called a Savings Account
      linked to the Base Rate. It means that the interest rate on your savings account
      will change in line with the Bank of England Base Rate. Would you like me to
      go through the key features and eligibility criteria for you?
  - speaker: Customer
    text: Yes please, I've tried contacting HSBC about it twice but haven't got much
      information.
  - speaker: Agent
    text: I understand that it can be frustrating when you're unable to get the information
      you need. The Savings Account linked to the Base Rate is available to existing
      HSBC savings customers. You can apply for it online or by calling our dedicated
      team. I can help you with the application process if you'd like?
  - speaker: Customer
    text: That's good to know, I've been finding this quite confusing.
  - speaker: Agent
    text: I'm here to help clarify any queries you might have. Is there anything else

      for these changes, and you can apply for the new rate online or by contacting
      us.

      platform or by visiting your local branch.
  - speaker: Customer
    text: Right, I see. And is there anything else I need to do or provide once I've

      prepare before applying.
  - speaker: Agent
    text: I understand your concern. While there's no need to prepare anything in
      particular before applying, it's always a good idea to have any relevant documents
      on hand, such as proof of address or income, just in case they're required during
      the application process.
  - speaker: Customer
    text: Got it. And just to clarify, there's nothing else I need to do or provide
      at this point?
  - speaker: Agent
    text: That's correct. Once you've applied, our team will take care of the rest.
      If you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to give us a call.

      our mortgage rates in line with the base rate set by the Bank of England. Your
      product terms may have changed as a result.

    text: This is unacceptable, I'm finding this quite frustrating.

    text: I've had enough, this is causing me a lot of trouble.
  - speaker: Agent
    text: I'm really sorry for any distress this may be causing you. We have a few
      options that might help. For instance, you could consider switching to a fixed-rate
      mortgage or changing the term of your mortgage. Additionally, we offer budgeting
      support if you'd find that helpful.

      us back and I'll help you further.
  - speaker: Customer

      permissions first.
  - speaker: Customer
    text: That's not really addressing the problem, though. I'd prefer a more definitive
      solution.
  - speaker: Agent
    text: Understood. In this case, I suggest we collect some diagnostics to better
      understand what's causing the issue. If it persists, I'll escalate it for further
      assistance.
  - speaker: Customer
    text: I see. I'm not entirely happy with this, but I suppose I'll have to wait
      and see.
  - speaker: Agent
    text: I completely understand your concerns. Let me explain the reauthorisation
      and refresh timing process to help clarify things. Once you've linked your accounts,
      they will need to be reauthorised periodically for security reasons. This usually
      happens every 90 days. If you've encountered this issue recently, it might be
      due to the timing.
  - speaker: Customer
    text: Ah, I see. That makes more sense now. I tried relinking the accounts, and
      it worked this time.

    text: I'm quite frustrated, could you tell me who handles claims if I purchase
      travel insurance through HSBC?
  - speaker: Agent
    text: Of course, I can see why this is important to you. According to our records,
      claims for travel insurance purchased through HSBC are handled directly by the
      insurance provider.
  - speaker: Customer
    text: I see, but I'm still not entirely happy with this. Could you clarify the
      roles and responsibilities of both HSBC and the insurance partner in handling
      claims?
  - speaker: Agent
    text: Absolutely, I'd be happy to explain. HSBC acts as the intermediary, facilitating
      the sale of the insurance policy. Once the policy is in effect, any claims would
      be handled directly by the insurance provider.
  - speaker: Customer
    text: I understand, but I'm still concerned about some key exclusions. Could you
      clarify those at a high level?
  - speaker: Agent
    text: Certainly, I'd be happy to help. Key exclusions may include pre-existing
      medical conditions, certain extreme sports or activities, and travel to high-risk
      destinations. However, the specifics may vary depending on the policy you've
      chosen.
  - speaker: Customer
    text: Alright, I think I have a better understanding now. Is there anything else
      I need to note on my account regarding this travel insurance?
  - speaker: Agent

      to contact us.
  - speaker: Customer
    text: Okay, I appreciate your help. That's all for now.

      that must be met in order to be eligible for the product. These terms may include
      things like minimum age, residency status, and income level. As for the application
      process, you can typically apply online or by visiting a local HSBC branch.
      Would you prefer one method over the other?

    text: I understand your concerns. Let's try some basic troubleshooting steps for
      your app. First, please restart the app by closing it completely and then reopening
      it. If that doesn't work, you can try updating the app to the latest version.
      If the issue persists, we may need to uninstall and then reinstall the app.
      I'll guide you through the process for each of these steps.
